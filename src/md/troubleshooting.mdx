  No words on DSM?
</Heading>
You can change the output from the switcher in Atem. In the 'Outputs' menu, change
the 'DSM' output to point to 'Room' instead of 'DSM'. That way the band will see
the same thing as the audience.

This usually happens when we forget to add a 'stage' action to the slides in the song.
Don't forget to fix the stage action on that song after service so it doesn't happen again
and set the 'DSM' output back to 'DSM'

#### to fix the song:

1. Highlight all the slides in the song except for the copyright slide
2. Right click any of them.
3. Click 'Add action', then 'Stage'
   If there is already a stage action, you may have to remove it first.
4. You'll see a dropdown for actions, choose 'DSM'
